Artificial intelligence is powering the modern world. Every time you use you phone or laptop, you are using AI, whether you notice it or not. It's here to stay, and it's getting better _every single day_.

For AI to work, it needs two things: <span class="underline">data and lots of processing power</span>. Training AIs takes time; slow hardware slows down innovation. Re-inventing the wheel does too.

If you are training your own learning algorithms on big problems, you need CPU and GPU grunt to do it effectively. With the public cloud, <span class="underline">you can spin up CPU and GPU compute as needed, paying only for what you use</span>.

If you want to do transcription, entity recognition, sentiment analysis, text-to-speech, or image & video recognition for standard use cases, cloud vendors offer fully managed services to suit your needs. <span class="underline">No training, no algorithm design. Just make an API call and you're done</span>. You'll benefit from any improvement in the underlying AI without having to do anything.

Need to deploy your AI prediction endpoint? No problem. With the public cloud and serverless technologies, <span class="underline">deploying secure, scalable model endpoints is a breeze</span>. You'll never have to worry about your API buckling under pressure again.

At Nordcloud, we believe that cloud services and AI are a match made in heaven. Modern AI is powered by the cloud, and together, they are enabling digital services the likes of which we've never seen before. Drop us a line and let's shape the future together.
